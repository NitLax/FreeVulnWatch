The issue involves mismatched length fields in Zlib compressed protocol headers that can potentially allow an unauthenticated client to read uninitialized heap memory. The vulnerability spans a wide range of MongoDB Server versions, including v7.0 prior to 7.0.28, v8.0 prior to 8.0.17, v8.2 prior to 8.2.3, v6.0 prior to 6.0.27, v5.0 prior to 5.0.32, v4.4 prior to 4.4.30, and versions v4.2.0 and higher, v4.0.0 and higher, and v3.6.0 and higher. This vulnerability could potentially expose sensitive memory information to an unauthenticated remote client through improper handling of compressed protocol headers.",

When a failure occurs within drm_gem_shmem_create(), the buffer object is not completely created, and the ivpu_gem_bo_free() callback will not be executed.

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: uas: fix urb unmapping issue when the uas device is remove during ongoing data transfer\n\nWhen a UAS device is unplugged during data transfer, there is\na probability of a system panic occurring. The root cause is\nan access to an invalid memory address during URB callback handling.\nSpecifically, this happens when the dma_direct_unmap_sg() function\nis called within the usb_hcd_unmap_urb_for_dma() interface, but the\nsg->dma_address field is 0 and the sg data structure has already been\nfreed.\n\nThe SCSI driver sends transfer commands by invoking uas_queuecommand_lck()\nin uas.c, using the uas_submit_urbs() function to submit requests to USB.\nWithin the uas_submit_urbs() implementation, three URBs (sense_urb,\ndata_urb, and cmd_urb) are sequentially submitted. Device removal may\noccur at any point during uas_submit_urbs execution, which may result\nin URB submission failure. However, some URBs might have been successfully\nsubmitted before the failure, and uas_submit_urbs will return the -ENODEV\nerror code in this case. The current error handling directly calls\nscsi_done(). In the SCSI driver, this eventually triggers scsi_complete()\nto invoke scsi_end_request() for releasing the sgtable. The successfully\nsubmitted URBs, when being unlinked to giveback, call\nusb_hcd_unmap_urb_for_dma() in hcd.c, leading to exceptions during sg\nunmapping operations since the sg data structure has already been freed.\n\nThis patch modifies the error condition check in the uas_submit_urbs()\nfunction. When a UAS device is removed but one or more URBs have already\nbeen successfully submitted to USB, it avoids immediately invoking\nscsi_done() and save the cmnd to devinfo->cmnd array. If the successfully\nsubmitted URBs is completed before devinfo->resetting being set, then\nthe scsi_done() function will be called within uas_try_complete() after\nall pending URB operations are finalized. Otherwise, the scsi_done()\nfunction will be called within uas_zap_pending(), which is executed after\nusb_kill_anchored_urbs().\n\nThe error handling only takes effect when uas_queuecommand_lck() calls\nuas_submit_urbs() and returns the error value -ENODEV . In this case,\nthe device is disconnected, and the flow proceeds to uas_disconnect(),\nwhere uas_zap_pending() is invoked to call uas_try_complete().",

When used in conjunction with a server or proxy which incorrectly interprets a bare LF in a chunk extension as part of the extension, this could permit request smuggling. (CVE-2025-22871)\ngolang-jwt is a Go implementation of JSON Web Tokens. before 5.2.2 and 4.5.2, the function parse.ParseUnverified splits (via a call to strings.Split) its argument (which is untrusted data) on periods. As a result, in the face of a malicious request whose Authorization header consists of Bearer  followed by many period characters, a call to that function incurs allocations to the tune of O(n) bytes (where n stands for the length of the function's argument), with a constant factor of about 16. This issue is fixed in 5.2.2 and 4.5.2. (CVE-2025-30204)",
