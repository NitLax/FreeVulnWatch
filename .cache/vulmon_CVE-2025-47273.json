    "description": "A path traversal vulnerability exists in setuptools prior to version 78.1.1, affecting the `PackageIndex` component. This security issue allows an attacker to write files to arbitrary locations on the filesystem using the permissions of the Python process. Depending on the specific context, this vulnerability could potentially lead to remote code execution. Users are advised to upgrade to version 78.1.1, which resolves the security problem and prevents unauthorized file writing.",
