    "description": "A vulnerability in the Linux kernel's accel/ivpu component has been addressed through a fix in the ivpu_bo_unbind_all_bos_from_context() function. The issue stems from adding a buffer object (BO) to the vdev->bo_list during ivpu_gem_create_object(). When a failure occurs within drm_gem_shmem_create(), the buffer object is not completely created, and the ivpu_gem_bo_free() callback will not be executed. This can result in a deleted buffer object remaining on the list, potentially causing page fault issues in the kernel's memory management.",
