    "description": "A vulnerability exists in MongoDB Server affecting multiple versions from v3.6.0 to v8.2.3. The issue involves mismatched length fields in Zlib compressed protocol headers that can potentially allow an unauthenticated client to read uninitialized heap memory. The vulnerability spans a wide range of MongoDB Server versions, including v7.0 prior to 7.0.28, v8.0 prior to 8.0.17, v8.2 prior to 8.2.3, v6.0 prior to 6.0.27, v5.0 prior to 5.0.32, v4.4 prior to 4.4.30, and versions v4.2.0 and higher, v4.0.0 and higher, and v3.6.0 and higher. This vulnerability could potentially expose sensitive memory information to an unauthenticated remote client through improper handling of compressed protocol headers.",
