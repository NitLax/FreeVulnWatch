    "description": "The Redirection for Contact Form 7 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the 'move_file_to_upload' function in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.7. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to copy arbitrary files on the affected site's server. If 'allow_url_fopen' is set to 'On', it is possible to upload a remote file to the server.",
