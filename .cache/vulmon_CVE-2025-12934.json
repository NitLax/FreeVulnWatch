    "description": "The Beaver Builder WordPress Page Builder plugin has a vulnerability in the 'duplicate_wpml_layout' function across all versions up to 2.9.4.1. This security issue allows authenticated attackers with Subscriber-level access or higher to improperly access and modify posts. Specifically, attackers can update posts with content from other existing posts, which could potentially expose private or password-protected content. The vulnerability is limited to posts originally created using Beaver Builder, and it enables unauthorized users to copy or update such posts, potentially leading to content deletion if the posts are not saved in revisions or backups.",
