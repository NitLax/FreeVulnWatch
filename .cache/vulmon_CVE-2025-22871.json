    "description": "The net/http package accepted data in the chunked transfer encoding containing an invalid chunk-size line terminated by a bare LF. When used in conjunction with a server or proxy which incorrectly interprets a bare LF in a chunk extension as part of the extension, this could permit request smuggling. (CVE-2025-22871)\ngolang-jwt is a Go implementation of JSON Web Tokens. before 5.2.2 and 4.5.2, the function parse.ParseUnverified splits (via a call to strings.Split) its argument (which is untrusted data) on periods. As a result, in the face of a malicious request whose Authorization header consists of Bearer  followed by many period characters, a call to that function incurs allocations to the tune of O(n) bytes (where n stands for the length of the function's argument), with a constant factor of about 16. This issue is fixed in 5.2.2 and 4.5.2. (CVE-2025-30204)",
