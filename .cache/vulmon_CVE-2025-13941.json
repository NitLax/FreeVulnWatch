    "description": "A local privilege escalation vulnerability has been discovered in Foxit PDF Reader/Editor Update Service. The issue stems from incorrect file system permissions assigned during plugin installation. These improper permissions allow a local attacker with low-level access to modify or replace critical resources used by the update service. By manipulating these resources, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code and gain SYSTEM-level privileges, which represents a significant security risk for the application.",
