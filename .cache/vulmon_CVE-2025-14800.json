    "description": "The Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin contains a security weakness that allows unauthenticated attackers to upload files without proper validation. In versions up to and including 3.2.7, the 'move_file_to_upload' function lacks file type checks, enabling malicious users to copy arbitrary files to the server. When the 'allow_url_fopen' setting is enabled, attackers can potentially upload remote files, posing a significant risk to the website's security.",
