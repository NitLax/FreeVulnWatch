    "description": "The Beaver Builder – WordPress Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access and modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'duplicate_wpml_layout' function in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.4.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update arbitrary posts with the content of other existing posts, potentially exposing private and password-protected content and deleting any content that is not saved in revisions or backups. Posts must have been created with Beaver Builder to be copied or updated.",
